Important info regarding changes

Version 20
	Added logging only scan options to conf.ini
		Look @ conf-example-log.ini for more info
		Scan Remotecontrol = log

Version 18
	Filters Renamed -> Rules
		New Internal File Format
			Read the Readme @ rules/Readme-rules.txt for more info
			
	servers.ini renamed to conf.ini (makes more sense)
	
	New Options
		Ban IP Time x
			Ability to set IP Ban Duration in hours (-1 = forever)

		Bans Shared = on
			If a pyBEscanner-ban is added to server with "Bans Shared = on",
			it is added to all other servers with "Bans Shared = on".
		Bans Symlinked = off
		Bans Symlinked Location = None
			If multiple servers have a bans.txt symlinked together. Use this option &
			set Bans Symlinked Location to location of a ban file.
			This will allow pyBEscanner to just monitor 1 ban file & reduce cpu / io / memory usage.
			Also a good way to test pyBEscanner for the paranoid (and entering wrong rcon info aswell)

-----------------------------------------------------------------
If your config version is under version 15.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Version 15
	Logging files are now located @ pyBEscanner/logs/
	All Temp Files are now located @ pyBEscanner/temp/
	New servers.ini settings
		Report Message -> New log file that is just an extra ban file with just bans from pyBEscanner.
							Allows admin to have a standard ban message, while still have a seperate file that will contain
								bans info with players name / guid / ip / date+time / server / log-file
		Bans Symlinked -> If u have your ban files symlinked (recommended), u should select this option.
							Otherwise everytime a ban is added to the file, each server (except the one that added the ban file),
							will rescan the bans.txt for changes. 
							Plus instead of just have 1 list of bans loaded, app will have a list of bans loaded per server.
		Bans Directory -> If u have Bans Symlinked Turned on, u will need to point it to a directory containing the bans.txt.
							Also will be the directory, were bans-pyBEscanner.txt will be created.

Version 13
	Revert Changes in 12,
	Recommend u use strict settings in createvehicle banlist etc instead...

Version 12
	Just a version incremant, so u will read this...
	The dayz-default\Createvehicle.banlist is now a catch all rule...
	It will ban for everything that isn't whitelisted...
	
	Its alot easier for us to just white-list the good items, and just have 1 rule to ban for everything else...
	If u are running a mod / map with items that need to be whitelist plz push an update / or make an issue on github. 
	Thx

	Removed Spam Option from servers.ini
	Added Supported for selecting multiple filters

	Altered array format in (offset & spam) temp files slighty...
